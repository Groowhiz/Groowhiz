      tip_three: "Calculate all costs for the project execution and rewards delivery. Also take into account your ability to engage people before you define your financial goal."
      title_four: "What is your deadline for the fundraising?"
      tip_four: "Don't underestimate the work that goes into a campaign. You will have to work hard during the entire time the project is live, so we don't want you to tire yourself out too much during this process. Our recommendation: 40 days of campaigning."
      title_five: "Have you thought about the project rewards?"
      tip_five: "Remember that rewards are public promises. So, think very carefully when elaborating them and consider the logistics in  how you'll deliver them to your contributors. Our suggestion: consider offering immaterial rewards: downloads, experiences, that sort of thing."
      title_six: "Is your video ready?"
      tip_six: "The video is your project's business card. It's through your video that supporters will get in touch with your cause. So take special care in the script, audio and image quality. HD video tends to help."
      title_seven: "How will you mobilize your network?"
      tip_seven: "You need to have a clear idea on how you will engage your network and convince them to contribute to your project. Distribute updates weekly, and be thoughtful about your approach to win your community's attenion and support."
      title_eight: "How will the money be used?"
      tip_eight: "Create a GOOGLE DOCS spreadsheet and open your budget to show everyone how the money will be used. Transparency is everything!"
      explore_curious: "Just looking around!"
      explore_projects: "I want to explore the projects."
